# simple chat

To run do : 

* `npm install`
* `nodemon`

Goto:

* `http://localhost:3010` - login as a user
*  To see user chat history goto: `http://localhost:3010/dashboard`

Currently you need to refresh to see new chat messages.

And the admin can't chat back yet. That is easy to add though.

The username needs to be unique and you can take chat session over based on a username!
